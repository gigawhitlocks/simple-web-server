This is a Web Server I implemented over the course of about two days for CS252 at Purdue. It has both multithreading and multiprocess modes; pool-of-threads was not implemented due to time constraints.

Some of the files are leftover from examples provided by the professor. The majority of the interesting code is in myhttpd.cc
